# Wasted Energy MCU Files

I hate it here. Look at the note at the top of WH_main.c for info about the build. You can try to flash the MCU with the hex file at dist/default/producttion/WastedHeat.X.production.hex. You can also build it yourself from source. All the header files are included in the XC8 compiler download so you shouldn't have to worry about that. 

Just a note, the PICKIT3 only works with MPLABX IDE/IPE 6.20 or lower.
